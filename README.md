# Calorie-tracker
Python GUI for tracking daily calories

My first python project

Users are able to add calories ether by an estimated value, by single ingredients or by already saved recipes.

There are listboxes for the search functions of the ingredients and the recipes. If the user enters an item not already saved in the database, he/she will be requested to enter the kcal values per 100g of the ingredient. Users can decide to enter scalable ingredients or entities (like one banana). New ingredients will be saved in food_data.json and recipes in recipes.json.
